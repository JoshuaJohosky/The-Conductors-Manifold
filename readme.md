## Real-Time Interpretation of Complex Systems

The Conductor's Manifold is a novel methodology for observing, interpreting, and understanding complex systems in real-time.

Traditional analysis focuses on past data points. This framework treats systems—such as financial markets, networks, or cultural trends—as living geometric manifolds. By analyzing curvature, tension, and flow, it provides actionable insights into the current state and structural evolution of the system.

This repository contains both the conceptual framework and **complete working implementation** - a production-ready platform for real-time manifold analysis.

## 🎵 The Conductor's Methodology

This system implements your **proprietary Manifold Interpreter** framework:

- **Geometric Manifold** - Markets as living shapes that evolve under pressure
- **Musical Composition** - Conductor (macro flow) + Singer (micro geometry) perspectives
- **Natural Structure** - Elliott Waves as curvature phases, Fibonacci as gravitational basins
- **Phase Diagnosis** - Impulse sharpening, singularity forming, Ricci flow smoothing
- **Interpretive Language** - "Curvature tightening," "tension releasing," "psychological heat"

Use `/api/v1/interpret/{symbol}` for complete Conductor's readings.
